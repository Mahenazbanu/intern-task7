### **Task Report: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions**

---

#### **Objective:**  
To identify and remove potentially harmful or suspicious browser extensions in order to improve browser security and performance.

---

#### **Browser Used:**  
Google Chrome (Version 125.0.0.0)

---

### **Steps Taken:**

1. **Opened the Extensions Manager:**
   - In Chrome, I navigated to `chrome://extensions/` via the address bar.

2. **Reviewed Installed Extensions:**
   - Enabled Developer Mode (top-right toggle) to see detailed info.
   - Reviewed all installed extensions for purpose, usage, and trustworthiness.

3. **Checked Permissions and Reviews:**
   - Clicked on each extension to view requested permissions.
   - Checked ratings and reviews from the Chrome Web Store for legitimacy.

4. **Identified Unused or Suspicious Extensions:**
   - Focused on:
     - Extensions not used recently.
     - Extensions requesting excessive permissions (e.g., full access to all websites, reading clipboard).
     - Extensions with few or low-star reviews.
     - Unknown or unrecognized developers.

5. **Removed Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions:**
   - Selected each flagged extension and clicked “Remove”.
   - Confirmed removal when prompted.

6. **Restarted the Browser:**
   - Restarted Chrome to ensure changes took effect.
   - Noted any improvements in speed or stability.

7. **Researched Malicious Extension Risks:**
   - Learned that malicious extensions can:
     - Steal browsing data and login credentials.
     - Inject ads or redirect searches.
     - Track user behavior without consent.
     - Slow down browser performance.
     - Install additional malware silently.

8. **Documented Findings:**
   - Listed all removed extensions and reasons for removal.

### **Suspicious Extensions Found and Removed:**

| Extension Name         | Reason for Removal |
|------------------------|--------------------|
| **"Quick Deals Plus"** | Adware-like behavior; injected unwanted ads; poor reviews; excessive permissions. |
| **"SaveFromHelper"**   | Frequently bundled with adware; no longer needed. |
| **"Coupon Popper"**    | Excessive tracking permissions; slowed browser; low rating. |
| **"Web Timer Pro"**    | Unknown developer; rarely used; unclear purpose. |
| **"PDF Converter+"**   | Requested access to all websites; minimal use. |

### **Performance Observations After Removal:**

- **Improved Page Load Times**: Pages loaded faster with fewer background processes.
- **Fewer Ads and Pop-ups**: Significant reduction in intrusive advertising.
- **Smoother Browsing Experience**: Scrolling and tab switching felt more responsive.

---

### **Conclusion:**

This exercise highlighted how easily users can unknowingly install browser extensions that compromise privacy, security, and performance. Regular audits of browser extensions are essential for maintaining a secure online presence. Going forward, I will be more cautious when installing new extensions and will verify their necessity and reputation beforehand.

### **Recommendations for Future Security:**

- Only install extensions from trusted developers.
- Review extension permissions before installation.
- Periodically audit and remove unused extensions.
- Use browser tools like Chrome’s built-in security features or third-party antivirus scanners.
- Stay informed about common signs of malicious extensions.
